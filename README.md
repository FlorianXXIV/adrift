# Adrift

This is a 2D prototype of a 3D space Game I want to create,

I got the idea for this from a YouTube Video by the creator "Blitz", the original premise was pretty simple, "Raft in Space."

I'm currently just learning how to write games with bevy, the engine used for this project, so I don't expect this to
ever become a fully functional game, which is supported by the fact that I have very little experience with both Rust
and Game Development in general.

Engine Used: Bevy v0.11.2
